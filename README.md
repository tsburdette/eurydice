# Eurydice

This is an IRC bot written in python. It's really just for me to get a feel for python and practice some stuff, but it could be useful as a task management tool as well.

## TODO

- Clean up dialogue.py. Shit's a mess.
- Add functionality for 
  - project status
  - notifications when a project is at another person
  - More silly responses and moe bullshit
  - Language parsing?

## Mailbox Organization

- TODO:
    - timezone parsing. Apparently there's a ctcp command for it.
    - let users know when they have mail
        - when the JOIN and when they talk in a channel?
